# Neo4j-Nodejs

npm install <br>
node app


A prototype project to test a full stack operation using Neo4j as data-server and Node.js as a webserver.
The templating is done in EJS and the front end javascript uses a mapping tool from MapboxGL.
The queries pull up Indian District-wise census data from the local server and load it on the 3d WebGL map in proporation to their heights.
